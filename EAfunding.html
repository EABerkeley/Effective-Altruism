	<h4>Good Ventures Grant:</h4>
	<p style="align:left">The philanthropic foundation Good Ventures gave us a $10,000 grant to support the Spring 2015 version of our DeCal. We used part of the money to play giving games during the class: every week, each student would get $20 and choose one of two charities to donate it to. The leftover money now supports our club operations and the Spring 2016 version of the DeCal. Their grant writeup and our detailed commentary are available <a href="http://www.goodventures.org/our-portfolio/grants/effective-altruists-of-berkeley-decal-university-course"> here</a>.
	</p>
	<br>
	&nbsp;
	<h4>Others:</h4>
	<p>We received a $100 unrestricted grant from Studypool, a leader in online homework help.</p>

	<p>Around $50-100 goes to donations done through giving games we play on Sproul plaza. We give you a dollar, and introduce you to two charities -- you get to choose where the dollar goes. </p>
<br>
&nbsp;
	<p>
		It's a fun and easy way to get into the habit of being thoughtful about giving -- come check us out Tuesdays from 11 AM to 1 PM!

		Around $4000-5000 will go to the DeCal. A few hundred dollars will cover travel expenses for some of our speakers. 
	</p>
<br>
	<p>
		The rest will be donated as part of larger in-class giving games -- students will get $20-50 to donate each game. We will also offer matching for any donation students make out of their own money until we run out of money.
